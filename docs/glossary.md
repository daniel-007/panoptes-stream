* Sensor Path
    > Describe the data you want to stream to collector. it's the YANG path or a subset of data definitions in a YANG model with a container

* gRPC Network Management Interface - gNMI
    > [gNMI](https://www.openconfig.net/projects/rpc/) is a unified management protocol for streaming telemetry and configuration management that leverages the open source [gRPC](https://www.grpc.io/) framework. for more information please visit [here](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/101/slides/slides-101-netconf-grpc-network-management-interface-gnmi-00).
* Junos Telemetry Interface - JTI
    > [Junos Telemetry Interface](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/information-products/pathway-pages/junos-telemetry-interface/junos-telemetry-interface.html) enables you to export telemetry data from supported interface hardware. Line card sensor data, such as interface events, are sent directly to configured collection points without involving polling. OpenConfig for Junos OS and the gRPC remote procedure call (gRPC) framework for exporting data are also supported. The J-Insight device monitor consumes the telemetry data delivered by the Junos Telemetry Interface to provide visibility and insight into the health of a running system.
* Model-driven Telemetry - MDT
    > Model-Driven Telemetry is a new approach for network monitoring in which data is streamed from network devices continuously using a push model and provides near real-time access to operational statistics. Applications can subscribe to specific data items they need, by using standard-based YANG data models over NETCONF-YANG. Cisco IOS [XE](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/prog/configuration/1612/b_1612_programmability_cg/model_driven_telemetry.html),[XR](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5000/telemetry/65x/b-telemetry-cg-ncs5000-65x/b-telemetry-cg-ncs5000-65x_chapter_010.html) and [NX-OS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x_chapter_011000.html) streaming telemetry allows to push data off of the device to an external collector at a much higher frequency, more efficiently, as well as data on-change streaming.
* OpenConfig
    > [OpenConfig](https://www.openconfig.net/) is an informal working group of network operators sharing the goal of moving our networks toward a more dynamic, programmable infrastructure by adopting software-defined networking principles such as declarative configuration and model-driven management and operations.

 * Dial-Out and Dial-In modes
    > In a dial-out mode, the router dials out to the collector.The device acts as a client and collector acts as a server.
    In a dial-in mode, the collector dials into the device. The collector acts as a client and device acts as a server.
